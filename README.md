## Project Description
As learners at BeCode we have been asked to complete a solo project with react. 
This is a basic Pomodoro App. 

### Challenges
My biggest challenge was to make sure the time ran as it should even when the tab is active. 
To do so I choose to learn about Web Workers, I implemented it in my code to manage the time interval. 

### Time 
We had 4 days to complete this challenge.
